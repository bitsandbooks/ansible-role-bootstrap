ns-bootstrap
=========

The **ns-bootstrap** role is a basic role used by all systems I currently run.

No known requirements beyond basic Ansible installation.

Dependencies
------------

No known dependencies.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: bitsandbooks.ns-bootstrap }
